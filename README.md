# Twitter Plays Snake
These scripts provide a simple snake game, simple visual outputs, and simple commands to deal with inputs from Twitter.

The Twitter account is [@letsplaysnake](http://twitter.com/letsplaysnake).

Instructions are in the account's bio.

And yes, it's all written in R. 

## Some rules

* The script gets one random tweet since its last update. Only the first command. Not more than one per player.
* If it gets no input, it keeps moving in the same direction like in the original game.
* Speed varies like in the version I was playing on a Macintosh (Classic?) long time ago. Tweets are more frequent as the snake gets longer.
* The mouse moves randomly, but not often. This was meant to avoid Twitter blocking the account when it gets no input and thus posts the same tweet twice.
* The board is a torus.
